# Project Presentation
Your project is coming to an end! Now that you have come up with some interesting findings you will need to present your project to me. Think of me as an interested party who will invest in your idea, a manager who is assessing your work, not a professor giving you a grade. You need to craft a story that will capture my attention. Your presentation should be no more than 10 minutes. If it goes over, I will stop watching right at the 10-minute mark. Each group member needs to be in the video speaking. The presentation will be graded on specific criteria (see table below). Each criteria has a maximum of 4 points.

You will need to record the video and audio along with your power point presentation in a video format that I can stream. The following are requirements for the presentation:
* Each group member must participate equally
* Each group member needs to appear in the presentation
* You must wear business dress (not business casual, but full business attire)
* 10 minutes maximum for the entire presentation; no more!

Please use YouTube, Vimeo, or some similar service to house your video. How do you record your video? I personally use Camtasia to record video, but that requires a purchased license. An excellent, free open-source option is OBS Project, which I have also used. You can see their GitHub page here https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio and download options here https://obsproject.com/download. OBS Project functions similarly to Camtasia and I highly recommend it.

Once the video is processed, edited, and uploaded you must submit the following on Canvas:
* A Word file with the link to the video
* Your Power Point presentation

The following table presents the grading criteria for the presentation. Please take note of each category. *Failure to include a category will result in reduction of all points for that category.* Each semester, one or two groups fail to include all categories. Please ensure you include each one. The table presents the categories on each row; the columns provide examples of how I grade each one. For example, for *Exploration: Visualization and Analysis* a 1-point effort entails "Very few figures, plots, etc.; no major analysis" while a 4-point effort is characterized as "All variables analyzed with figures, plots, etc."

One important caveat: If you plan on publishing your video as publicly viewable media, be sure not to include your student ID numbers.
