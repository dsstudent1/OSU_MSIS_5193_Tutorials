# Project Guidelines and Deliverables
This project allows you to combine all the skills, knowledge, ideas, practical tools, and technology into a single medium.  One of the best ways to learn something is to try to put this new knowledge into practice.  Using tools to perform regression or create a decision tree is straight forward enough when done in isolation.  However, developing a business goal, questions of interest, plans, hypotheses to test, and using the right tools and techniques all together is much harder.

## Your Team
The team size is ideally three or four members.  Teams of two are discouraged due to the amount of work to be done and the short time period allowed. Special permission is required for "teams" of one: if you desire to work alone, I will hold you to the same standard as a full-sized team. A team of one usually occurs because of legal constraints on data from a company. I suggest that you divide the extensive work required equitably among the team members while at the same time relying on the special strengths of each team member to allow the project to be completed within the strict time limits.

## Case of the Project
Your project case this semester is to come up with a business problem and/or goal, explore data, ask questions, assess it using various techniques, and provide a solution to that problem and/or goal. The data for your project must be gathered by you. You will gather data from the web including websites and social media platforms. This means no downloading of existing data gathered by another party. You will use your own program to scrape code from a website or social media site, insert the data into a tabular format, and prepare it for future analysis.  

When coming up with project ideas, try to do something interesting to you. **You cannot use a project that you are doing in another class**, whether it is in the past or during this semester. This also includes projects you are already working on with a faculty member. This must be original work.

## Deliverables
The deliverables have been broken up into a project proposal, two main deliverables, and a final presentation. Each team will submit one copy of each deliverable. Remember, professionalism and appearance will not cover mistakes; however, they do make mistakes seem more tolerable.

## Project Proposal
Each group should submit a Word document containing a 1-page summary of your proposed project. The purpose of this exercise is to be sure that you have an idea to get started with, that the idea is conducive to a data-driven application, and that the idea is something that can be accomplished, in whole or in part, over 16 weeks.  This proposal will not be graded strictly but is likely to indirectly impact your grade on future deliverables by hopefully preventing any team from "going back to the drawing board." The more you give me, the more feedback you get.

When you submit this document, please be sure to include the following:
* A one-sentence description of what your idea is. Keep this to a single sentence, presented at the beginning of your document.
* Identify the business opportunity or goal and how your project fulfills the goal(s) you have chosen.
* Discuss why this is important; i.e. tell me the business case. You must reference at least two sources to back up your claim (i.e. newspaper article, magazine article, research, etc.). You must cite these two sources!
* What data are you using? Provide me a list of websites, social media platforms, etc. (be specific and provide the url).
* Explain the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process for your data. What needs to be cleaned? What will be altered?
* Who are the clients, customers, or users that will benefit? Why?
* Who are the team members? Please register your team members in Canvas.
* GitHub Repository: Create a new repository for your project on GitHub. If you are using both R and Python, use a single repository for your code. Use different directories in your repository to house your code for Python and R.
