# Review HTML and CSS
An important goal this semester is learning how to scrape data from webpages. Prior to learning how to scrape data from the Web, you will need to have a decent understanding of HTML and CSS, the building blocks of websites. Not only do you need to familiarize yourself with HTML and CSS, but more importantly understand how they structurally fit together. This structure is what you will navigate with your web scraping tools.

This is like bouldering or rock climbing (both extremely fun, by the way!). Prior to climbing the face of the rock, you need to understand the structure of the rock face; where it slopes out, where it slopes in, crevices to provide footholds, strategic rest areas, where to use static movements versus dynamic ones. The structure of the rock face only starts to come together once you understand the different features and aspects 

If you have not participated in bouldering or climbing, it might help you better understand this analogy by watching the [IFSC Climbing World Cup 2019](https://youtu.be/3zE_InotBGo) that was in Vail. Observe the climbers prior to their climb at the 12:00 minute mark. They are assessing the different parts and planning their route. The Colvin Center on OSU's campus has a climbing wall that I highly recommend you try; it might help this analogy sink in. I usually take the MS-MIS students to this (as well as the ropes course) for their Fall Orientation activity and we always have lots of fun.

Understanding HTML and CSS for this course is not so much about learning how to build a website, but how to navigate the features and aspects found in a webpage. Climbers do not need to build a climbing wall in order to navigate it. 

I have a special love-hate relationship with HTML. I first began exploring HTML in Junior High in the 90s (yes, quite some time ago) and built my first webpage on Geocities (R.I.P my friend). Back then, HTML was very simple and basic, but also very ugly and lacked character and personality. This led me down the lifelong love of technology and the web. I worked as a web developer for Intel developing web-based healthcare interfaces, then as a web designer for Student Leadership at Brigham Young University while working on my undergraduate degree. 

In total, I have accumulated over 10 years of work experience. During this time I saw the web change and grow. Unlike most people who only saw the outward appearance, I was lucky enough to see the internal change, how HTML and CSS evolved. It is more complex, more dynamic, but also more beautiful and wonderful. 

I relate this because knowing how something works, the effort and resources that went into building it, gives you a whole new appreciation for it. If anything, I hope this tutorial provides you a greater appreciation for all the websites you use every day. Some of them we only spend a mere second on without thinking about what went into creating it. 

# Module Tasks
Please complete the following tasks:
* :notebook:Read the tutorial documentation below
* :school:Complete the ICE in class
* :computer:Complete the THA on your own

# Tutorial Documents
This tutorial is organized into three main sections:
* [Overview of HTML](assets/html-review.md)
* [Basics of CSS](assets/css-review.md)
* [CSS Selectors](assets/css-selectors.md)

The first section covers HTML including what it is, the different components of it, and how they are put together. The second section covers the mere basics of CSS. We could spend another week on the topic because CSS has so much to offer. Yet, you are not here to learn how to program CSS, merely how to use it to navigate HTML. The last section deals exclusively with navigating HTML using CSS. Thus, the first two sections give you the background knowledge and the last puts it all together.
