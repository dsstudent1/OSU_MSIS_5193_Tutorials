# Using and Manipulating Data
The purpose of this module is to help you become familiar with using R and Python. The most fundamental functions involve accessing data, importing data into the program, and manipulating that data into understandable formats. This requires knowledge of how to use a data frame to manipulate data.

You will learn how to import data into a data frame object, access the contents of the data frame by index values, sort the data, and several other functions and methods.
